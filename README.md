E-Commerce Platform with Telegram Bot Integration
A powerful and user-friendly e-commerce platform built with React, Express, Node.js, Stripe, Tailwind CSS, Firebase Database and Auth, and the Telegram Bot API. This platform allows store owners to manage products, process purchases, and sync data seamlessly between the website and Telegram.

The standout feature of this project is its Telegram bot integration, which makes managing both the website and Telegram channel effortless. Store owners can create, update, or delete product listings directly from Telegram, and these changes are automatically reflected on the website. The system also notifies the owner of purchases via Telegram messages, providing a streamlined management experience.

Key Features
CRUD Operations via Telegram:
The e-commerce platform integrates with a Telegram bot that allows store owners to manage product listings (create, update, delete) directly from the bot. Changes made in the Telegram bot are automatically reflected on both the website and Telegram channel.

Exclusive and Channel Posts:
Owners can choose whether a product post should be exclusive to the website or should appear both on the website and the Telegram channel. This flexibility allows for better content management across multiple platforms.

Seamless Synchronization:
If a product is edited or deleted on Telegram, the corresponding post on the website is automatically updated or removed. Similarly, changes on the website are mirrored on the Telegram bot and channel.

Telegram as a Data Store:
The Telegram bot not only facilitates product management but can also serve as an alternative, secure data storage solution. It ensures that data is protected and backed up in a more secure manner than traditional Firebase.

Stripe Integration for Payments:
Stripe is integrated to handle payments securely. When users purchase items, they can check out directly on the website, and the store owner will receive a notification with the purchase details via Telegram.

Real-Time Notifications via Telegram:
When a purchase is made, the store owner is immediately notified through a Telegram message containing the userâ€™s details, including the purchased items. This keeps the owner up to date with sales in real-time.

Firebase Database and Authentication:
Firebase is used for user authentication and as the primary database for storing user data, orders, and product details. This ensures secure access control and scalable data management.

Responsive Design:
Built with Tailwind CSS, the platform provides a responsive and clean design that adapts seamlessly to both desktop and mobile devices.
